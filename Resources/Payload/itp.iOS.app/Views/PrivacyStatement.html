                <p>Our collection of personal data will be limited to the information required to provide access to the information stored within the Portal. Such information may include your name, title, company address, email, telephone and fax numbers. This information may be collected either:</p>

                    <li>Directly from you. Where you are asked to provide data such as when you register, use any “Contact Us” features of the Portal; or</li>
                    <li>Indirectly, such as using cookies (as described below) or customizing software to tailor the Portal to your preferences or to track your use of certain pages of the Portal (e.g. your internet protocol address) and other technical means to monitor your use of the Portal or from third parties who provide us with information about you.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If you are acting as an intermediary or otherwise on behalf of a third party or supply us with information regarding a third party (such as your employer or a client company), you undertake that you are an authorized representative or agent of such third party and that you have obtained all necessary consents from such third party to the collection, processing, use and disclosure by us of their personal data. Because we are collecting the third party’s data from you, you undertake to make the third party aware of all matters listed in this Privacy Statement, preferably by distributing a copy of this statement to them or by referring them to this Portal.</p>

                <h3>How is personal data secured?</h3>
                <p>We have implemented generally accepted standards of technology and operational security in order to protect personal information from loss, misuse, alteration or destruction. Only authorized personnel are provided access to personally identifiable information and these employees have agreed to ensure confidentiality of this information.</p>
                <h3>Are cookies used on the website?</h3>
                <p>Cookies may be used on some pages of our site. “Cookies” are small text files placed on your hard drive to assist in providing a more customized Portal experience. For example, a cookie can be used to store registration information in an area of the Portal so that a user does not need to re-enter it on subsequent visits to that area.

                <p>In order to properly manage the Portal we may pass log information on to our operational systems, and identify categories of visitors by items such as domains and browser types. These statistics are reported in the aggregate to our webmasters. This is to ensure that the Portal presents the best web experience for visitors and is an effective information resource.</p>
