<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last Updated: November 4, 2019</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please read these Terms of Service (the "Agreement") carefully. Your use of the Solution (as defined below) constitutes your consent to this Agreement.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Agreement is between you and PwC Product Sales LLC (&ldquo;PwC&rdquo; or &ldquo;we&rdquo; or &ldquo;us&rdquo;) concerning your use of (including any access to) certain PwC digital products, namely the &ldquo;Policy on Demand&rdquo; Solution currently located at <a href="https://policyondemand.pwc.com">https://policyondemand.pwc.com</a> (together with any materials and services available on or through such site, and successor site(s) thereto) and available through a downloadable mobile application (the &ldquo;Solution&rdquo;).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BY USING THE SOLUTION, YOU AFFIRM THAT YOU ARE OF LEGAL AGE TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT OR, IF YOU ARE NOT, THAT YOU HAVE OBTAINED PARENTAL OR GUARDIAN CONSENT TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IF YOU ARE AN INDIVIDUAL ACCESSING OR USING THE SOLUTION ON BEHALF OF, OR FOR THE BENEFIT OF, ANY CORPORATION, PARTNERSHIP OR OTHER ENTITY WITH WHICH YOU ARE ASSOCIATED (AN &ldquo;ORGANIZATION&rdquo;), THEN YOU ARE AGREEING TO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF YOURSELF AND SUCH ORGANIZATION, AND YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH ORGANIZATION TO THIS AGREEMENT. References to &ldquo;you&rdquo; and &ldquo;your&rdquo; in this Agreement will refer to both the individual using the Solution and to any such Organization; however, if such Organization and PwC enter into a separate written agreement relating to the Solution or other subject matter of this Agreement, such separate written agreement will govern such Organization&rsquo;s access to and use of the Solution and supersede this Agreement to the extent and as set forth in such separate written agreement.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION THAT, AS FURTHER SET FORTH IN SECTION 17 BELOW, REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR ANY OTHER COURT PROCEEDINGS, OR CLASS ACTIONS OF ANY KIND.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Changes. We may change this Agreement from time to time by notifying you of such changes by any reasonable means, including by posting a revised Agreement through the Solution.

</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your use of the Solution following any changes to this Agreement will constitute your acceptance of such changes.

We may, at any time and without liability, modify or discontinue all or part of the Solution (including access to the Solution via any third-party links); charge, modify or waive any fees required to use the Solution; or offer opportunities to some or all Solution users.&nbsp;</span></p>

For each Submission, you hereby grant to us a worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid-up, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable and fully sublicensable (through multiple tiers) license, without additional consideration to you or any third party, to reproduce, distribute, perform and display (publicly or otherwise), create derivative works of, adapt, modify and otherwise use, analyze, exploit and practice such Submission, in any format or media now known or hereafter developed, and for any purpose (including promotional purposes, such as testimonials).&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, if you provide to us any ideas, proposals, suggestions or other information or materials (&ldquo;Feedback&rdquo;), whether related to the Solution or otherwise, such Feedback will be deemed a Submission, and you hereby acknowledge and agree that such Feedback is not confidential, and that your provision of such Feedback is gratuitous, unsolicited and without restriction, and does not place PwC under any fiduciary or other obligation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to grant the licenses granted in this Section, and that your Submissions, and your provision thereof through and in connection with the Solution, are complete and accurate, and are not fraudulent, tortious or otherwise in violation of any applicable law or any right of any third party.

</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">access to and use of the Solution, and the circumstances surrounding such access and use, to anyone in connection with performing services for you, in connection with operating the Solution, or for analytic, statistical, security, quality control, and similar purposes (including in aggregate form, e.g., to analyze systems performance).&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol start="9">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Your Limited Rights. Subject to your compliance with this Agreement, and solely for so long as you are permitted by PwC (and, if applicable, your Organization) to access and use the Solution, you may view one (1) copy of any portion of the Solution to which we provide you access under this Agreement, on any single device, solely for your personal, non- commercial use. If you fail to comply with any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement, you must immediately cease using the Solution.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> PwC&rsquo;s Proprietary Rights. We and our suppliers own the Solution, which is protected by proprietary rights and laws. As between you and us, the Solution and all non-public information and materials (technical, business and otherwise) related to the Solution (and the use of it), including Submissions of other Solution users, are our &ldquo;Confidential Information&rdquo; and you will not use or disclose to third parties Confidential Information except to the extent necessary to exercise your rights and fulfill your obligations under this Agreement or as required by applicable law. Our trade names, trademarks and service marks include the name &ldquo;PricewaterhouseCoopers&rdquo; and &ldquo;PwC&rdquo; and any associated logos, marks and designs. All trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos and designs on the Solution not owned by us are the property of their respective owners. You may not use our trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos or designs in connection with any product or service that is not ours, or in any manner that is likely to cause confusion. Nothing contained on the Solution should be construed as granting any right to use any trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos or designs without the express prior written consent of the owner.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> CPA Notice; PwC Related Parties; Nature of Engagement. PwC is owned by professionals who hold CPA licenses as well as by professionals who are not licensed CPAs. Depending on the nature of the products and services provided to you under this Agreement (including the Solution or through the Solution), non-CPA owners may be involved in providing such products and services. PwC is a firm in the global network of separate and independent PricewaterhouseCoopers firms (exclusive of PwC, the &ldquo;Other PwC Firms&rdquo;). PwC may draw on the resources of (and subcontract to) its affiliates, the Other PwC Firms and third party contractors and subcontractors, within or outside of the United States (each, a &ldquo;PwC Service Provider&rdquo;) for internal, administrative and regulatory compliance purposes or in connection with providing the Solution. The PwC Service Providers and their and PwC&rsquo;s respective partners, principals, employees and agents (collectively, the &ldquo;PwC Beneficiaries&rdquo;) will have no liability or obligations arising out of this Agreement, and you agree to bring any claim or other legal proceeding of any nature arising from or related to this Agreement or its subject matter against PwC and not against the PwC Beneficiaries. While PwC is entering into this Agreement on its own behalf, this Section 11 also is intended for the benefit of the PwC Beneficiaries. This Solution does not include, and is not intended to constitute, tax advice and, therefore, is not subject to Treasury Department Circular 230 and/or Internal Revenue Code &sect; 6694. Any services requested by you, or proposed by PwC, that would constitute tax advice will be provided under a separate engagement letter, including appropriate terms and conditions, with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Third Party Materials; Links. Certain Solution functionality may make available access to information, products, services and other materials made available by third parties, including Submissions (&ldquo;Third Party Materials&rdquo;), or allow for the routing or transmission of such Third Party Materials, including via links. By using such functionality, you are directing us to access, route and transmit to you the applicable Third Party Materials.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We neither control nor endorse, nor are we responsible for, any Third Party Materials, including the accuracy, validity, timeliness, completeness, reliability, integrity, quality, legality, usefulness or safety of Third Party Materials, or any intellectual property rights therein. Certain Third Party Materials may, among other things, be inaccurate, misleading or deceptive. Nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to be a representation or warranty by PwC with respect to any Third Party Materials. We have no obligation to monitor Third Party Materials, and we may block or disable access to any Third Party Materials (in whole or part) through the Solution at any time. In addition, the availability of any Third Party Materials through the Solution does not imply our endorsement of, or our affiliation with, any provider of such Third Party Materials, nor does such availability create any legal relationship between you and any such provider.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">YOUR USE OF THIRD PARTY MATERIALS IS AT YOUR OWN RISK AND IS SUBJECT TO ANY ADDITIONAL TERMS, CONDITIONS AND POLICIES APPLICABLE TO SUCH THIRD PARTY MATERIALS (SUCH AS TERMS OF SERVICE OR PRIVACY POLICIES OF THE PROVIDERS OF SUCH THIRD PARTY MATERIALS).&nbsp;</span></p>

<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Termination. This Agreement is effective until terminated.

PwC may terminate or suspend your use of the Solution at any time and without prior notice, for any reason, including if PwC believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of this Agreement.

Sections 2 through 8 and 10 through 21 will survive any termination of this Agreement.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Governing Law; Arbitration. This Agreement, and any dispute relating to this Agreement or the subject matter of this Agreement, will be governed by and construed, interpreted and enforced in accordance with the domestic laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any provisions that would require the laws of another jurisdiction to apply and regardless of your location. The parties expressly disclaim the applicability of, and waive any rights based on, the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act, the Uniform Commercial Code, or the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, however each may be codified or amended. ALL DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING THE SOLUTION AND THE USE THEREOF) OR ANY ASPECT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND PWC UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE, FRAUD, MISREPRESENTATION OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, WILL BE RESOLVED THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION BEFORE A NEUTRAL PANEL OF THREE ARBITRATORS INSTEAD OF IN A COURT BY A JUDGE OR JURY AND YOU AGREE THAT PWC AND YOU ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY A JURY.

<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Copyright Infringement Claims. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the &ldquo;DMCA&rdquo;) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials available on the Solution infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send to PwC a written notice by mail or e-mail, requesting that PwC remove such material or block access to it. If you believe in good faith that someone has wrongly filed a notice of copyright infringement against you, the DMCA permits you to send to PwC a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA. See <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/">http://www.copyright.gov</a> for details. Notices and counter-notices must be sent in writing to PwC&rsquo;s DMCA agent as follows: By mail to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Attn: DMCA Agent, Office of the General Counsel, Three Embarcadero Center, San Francisco, CA 94111; by e-mail to US_DMCA@pwc.com; or by fax to the fax number that we will provide to you if you request such fax number by contacting PwC&rsquo;s DMCA agent by mail, e-mail or telephone at the addresses or phone number provided in this Section.

<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Miscellaneous. This Agreement does not, and will not be construed to, create any partnership, joint venture, employer-employee, agency or franchisor-franchisee relationship between you and PwC. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, that provision will be deemed severable from this Agreement and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provision. You may not assign, transfer or sublicense any or all of your rights or obligations under this Agreement without our express prior written consent. We may assign, transfer or sublicense any or all of our rights or obligations under this Agreement without restriction. No waiver by either party of any breach or default under this Agreement will be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. Any heading, caption or section title contained herein is for convenience only, and in no way defines or explains any section or provision. All terms defined in the singular will have the same meanings when used in the plural, where appropriate and unless otherwise specified. Any use of the term &ldquo;including&rdquo; or variations thereof in this Agreement will be construed as if followed by the phrase &ldquo;without limitation.&rdquo; This Agreement, including any terms and conditions incorporated herein, is the entire agreement between you and PwC relating to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous written or oral agreements or understandings between you and PwC relating to such subject matter. Notices to you (including notices of changes to this Agreement) may be made via posting through the Solution or by e-mail (including in each case via links), or by regular mail.

</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement, claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation, and claims with respect to intellectual property infringement. Any inquiries or complaints relating to the use of the Solution, including those pertaining to intellectual property rights, must be directed to PwC in accordance with the &ldquo;Information or Complaints&rdquo; section above.
